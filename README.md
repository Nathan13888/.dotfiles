# Dot Files

A dotfiles repository containing Nathan's personal dotfiles that he uses with debian/ubuntu systems.

Three other Github repositories for fonts are included as a submodule of this repository.

Use the INSTALL scripts to create new symlinks in a new or existing Debian/Ubuntu system.

# Scripts
- `FULL-INSTALL.sh` --> install everything for a complete Ubuntu system running GNOME
- `MIN-INSTALL.sh` --> install the least dotfiles that do not effect the system (eg. aliases)
- `WSL-INSTALL.sh` --> install in a debian WSL system
- `ETC-INSTALL.sh` --> installing configs that are in `/etc/`
- `EXTRA-INSTALL.sh` --> install other things

- `UPDATE-SUBMODULES.sh` --> update submodules of this respository
